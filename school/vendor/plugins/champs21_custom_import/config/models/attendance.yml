# Please refer to employee.yml for basic concept.

# Forenoon and afternoon are boolean fields.It will only be having true and false values.Whenever such
# columns comes,place all those inside booleans array.If any value is present in the csv for those
# it will enter an entry as true,if left blank,will be entered as false

# Batch will be entered as full name only.But cannot be searched as search.Bacause no such column called
# full_name is there in the database.But full name can be fetched by method.
# Value will be a combination of course code and batch name.Such kind of case,where a method is to be used
# to search an associated value,to be placed inside map_combination hash.
