    <title>Since Thursday, interns and employees of National Medical College Hospital have been at loggerheads over a ward boy entering the restroom meant for the interns. On Saturday, all hell broke loose with interns and staffers clashing inside the hospital. The clash left the reception, top right, and the entrance to the emergency section, bottom right, in ruins and 15 people hurt. The hospital sent all interns on a two-day holiday following the incident so that a probe could be done, while the interns declared an indefinite strike. The violence scared many patients away. Many who were admitted to the hospital left in inadequate care. Some, however, were too weak to move as seen in the photo of a patient on a bed on the fifth floor of the hospital.
