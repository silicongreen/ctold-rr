                Go through the new Spellato thoroughly, particularly the  <strong><i>‘Word Watch’</i></strong> section of Spellato 2015. In this section you will find the <strong><i>suggestion words</i></strong> which are bound to show up in the Spelling Bee 2015 competition. The Spellato also contains all the words used in the previous Spelling Bee Seasons, which will give you a solid idea about the competition.

                Always remember, ‘Practice makes perfect’; the more you practice, the more you’ll learn and be more confident eventually. <strong><i>Increase your English reading habits;</i></strong> this could be from:
                <ul>
                    <li>Champs21.com website, where many interesting content are published everyday,</li>
                    <li>English newspapers (www.thedailystar.net),</li>
                    <li>novels, or elsewhere.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                At the same time, <strong><i>set up a target of learning twenty new words every day</i></strong>. Get yourself the new Spellato or just a dictionary and maintain a pocket journal for learning words. Keep a specific time every day for testing your own spelling skills.

                Make <strong><i>a list of your commonly misspelled words</i></strong>.When you catch yourself spelling the same word wrong over and over, write it down somewhere. When you get a chance, look it up and put the correct spelling next to it. (Make sure you mark which is correct!)

                The only way to really learn a word is to use it. When you look up how to spell a word, <strong><i>write it down several times in a row</i></strong>, and do it again a day or two later – you’re trying to build up the motor memory of writing it correctly spelled. Write a blog, a journal, an email, or anything that will keep you using words – and pay special attention as you write to the words that come up wrong using your spell checker.

                Bear in mind that all the spellings used in Spelling Bee are in <strong><i>British English</i></strong>.
