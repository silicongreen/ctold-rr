# every YAML file should contain all the content inside model_name.underscore hash.

# If database columns names needed to be modfied then it should be placed in overrides hash.

# Mention all the associations those arec needed in CSV upload inside associations_array.

# Assoicated columns needs a field that will be searched for getting an ID to place.For example
# nationality_id needs to be searched in country table by name which will be present in CSV.All those
# required field to be placed in associated_columns hash.Association name is the key and field will be value.

# Mention all those database columns which u dont want to appear in CSV inside filters array.Note that
#  id,created_at,updated_at does not needs any mention inside filters.

# If there is any join table data to be uploaded with CSV.Please mention that join name as key
# and table name as value in joins hash.In this case privilege is the privileges_users is the table.So
# entry will be privileges: users

# This concept also same as the associated data.Mention the column by which join column names will be searched.
# In this case privilege table will be searched by name.

# There can be many additional data to upload while uploading a model data.Place all those additional
# association names and parent names in associates hash.For example we have to upload employee bank detail,
# so all the values from bank detail to be fetched,thats why the entry is like employee_bank_details: "bank_field".
# All the current active bank fields will be appearing then to save in the structure.

# The data user will be entering needed to be saved somewhere in the assoiated model.Mention those column names
# inside associate_columns hash.For example someone entered his passport number as an additional detail.
# This passport_number column to be get from additional_field table,then have to save the id in
# employee_additional_detail table with a value for that in additional_info column.So the enry should be
# employee_additional_detail: "additional_info"

# Every associated parent model value to be searched by a column.For example,all the bank fields to be
# searched by name from the bank_field table.Mention all those values inside associate_column_search hash.
