#page breaking implemented page
#'available_sections' marks beginning of a pdf page, all the contents within a 'section' class beneath -
#the 'available_section' will be taken to another div with a class 'page' dynamically by the javascript -
#written in layouts/pdf.html.erb. 'page' has style for page-break-after:auto property which makes sure -
#content within class 'section' breaks on each page if its the last content and no space left in current page
#warning: the 'page' div is created directly below html , so style your pdf keeping that in mind.
#point to note: make an easy guess the length of content a page can hold, and make sure each 'section' will -
#not exceed the a page size, like we did below for student_additional_fields, we force a new table to be drawn -
#each time the row count reaches 28, as 28 being the max number of rows an A4 can hold.
#avoid creating deeper nests, make 'section' simpler.
